+ Profit: Use POJO (Entity) with Mongodb 

- chk: Bollinger trade position
- Generate learning data (Looking for the best profit) + Save it in the candle
- Save Profit sample start stop dates
- Simulate trade (from the learning data)
- calc: Candle.Date (easter, Pentecost, halloween)

Future:
--------
- Implement RSI
- Self learning with Neural networks
- Optimize mongodb
- Candle1d (one day) + Simulation
- Separate mongodb logic 
- Eclipse Micro 3.3
- Change JDK (11LTS?)


Optional:
---------
- Use POJO (Entity) with Mongodb (Next JakartaEE? )
- Code review findbugs or sonar
- EJB timeout exception - Move to Bath processing?
- Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
